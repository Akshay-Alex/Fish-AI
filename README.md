# Fish-AI
A unity project in which I implemented BOIDS flocking algorithm to generate movement on a school of fish.

In the BOIDS algorithm each fish follows three rules.
1. separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates.
2. alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates.
3. cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates.
